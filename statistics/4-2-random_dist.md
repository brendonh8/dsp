[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

```python
import nupmy as np
t = np.random.random(1000)

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')
```
This PMF looks like a bunch of random bars all at .001 probability. This makes sense sinse np.random.random uses a uniform set of floats, which means every value has the same probability. 

```python
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')
```
The CDF of the uniform data is linear. Since each value has the same probability, the percentage of data within some point is going to increase linearly.
